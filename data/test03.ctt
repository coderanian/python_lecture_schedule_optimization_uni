Name: Should have three day penalties
Description: Course c00 cannot be held on day 0 because of unavailability constraints, so all lectures will be held on day 1 instead. Because c01 is held by the same teacher, that course is gonna be completely held on day 0, again violating the min_working_days constraint. c02 needs the 50-person room, which is completely filled on day 0 by c01, so all c02 lectures need to be held on day 1, again violating the min_working_days constraint.
Objective_value: 0.3
Note: If room constraints are not implemented, you will get an objective value of 0.2
