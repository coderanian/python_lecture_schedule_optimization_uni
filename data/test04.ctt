Name: Should have one assistant penalty, one student penalty, one unavailability penalties
Description: Course c00 needs to be held 4 times, but day 0 is completely unavailable, which we violate. Teacher t0 is supposed to hold 7 lectures in 6 timeslots, so an assistant will have to jump in at some point. Additionally, since there are 7 lectures of c00+c01 in 6 slots, there is sure to be an overlap for curriculum q01, too.
